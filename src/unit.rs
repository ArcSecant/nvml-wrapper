/**
Struct that represents a unit. 

Obtain a `Unit` with the various methods available to you on the `NVML`
struct.

I don't know what a unit is, but inferring from the docs leads me to believe 
it's some kind of high-end something-or-other that 99% of users won't know 
about either. That being said, I'm wrapping this whole library, so here you go.

Rust's lifetimes will ensure that the NVML instance this `Unit` was created from
is not allowed to be shutdown until this `Unit` is dropped, meaning you shouldn't
have to worry about calls returning `Uninitialized` errors.
